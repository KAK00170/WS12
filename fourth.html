      The Peace reconfirmed "German liberties", ending Habsburg attempts to convert the Holy Roman Empire
       into a more centralised state similar to Spain. Over the next 50 years, Bavaria, Brandenburg-Prussia,
        Saxony and others increasingly pursued their own policies, while Sweden gained a permanent foothold
         in the Empire. Despite these setbacks, the Habsburg lands suffered less from the war than many 
         others and became a far more coherent bloc with the absorption of Bohemia, and restoration of 
         Catholicism throughout their territories.
    </p>
    <p>
      By laying the foundations of the modern nation state, Westphalia changed the relationship between 
      subjects and their rulers. Previously, many had overlapping, sometimes conflicting, political and 
      religious allegiances; they were now understood to be subject first and foremost to the laws and 
      edicts of their respective state authority, not the claims of any other entity, religious or secular. 
      This made it easier to levy national forces of significant size, loyal to their state and its leader; 
      one lesson learned from Wallenstein and the Swedish invasion was the need for their own permanent 
      armies, and Germany as a whole became a far more militarised society.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Sweden, the benefits ultimately proved short-lived. Unlike French gains which were incorporated 
      into France, Swedish territories remained part of the Empire, and they became members of the Lower 
      and Upper Saxon kreis. While this provided both seats and influence in the Imperial Diet, it also 
      brought Sweden into direct conflict with Brandenburg-Prussia and Saxony, their competitors in 
      Pomerania. The income from their German possessions was relatively minor, and although parts of 
      Pomerania remained Swedish until 1815, much of it was ceded to Prussia in 1679 and 1720.
    </p>
    <p>
      France arguably gained more from the conflict than any other power, and by 1648, most of Richelieu's 
      objectives had been achieved. These included separation of the Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs, 
      expansion of the French frontier into the Empire, and an end to Spanish military supremacy in 
      Northern Europe. Although the Franco-Spanish war continued until 1659, Westphalia allowed Louis 
      XIV to begin replacing Spain as the predominant European power.
    </p>
    <p>
      While religion remained a divisive political issue in many countries, the Thirty Years' War is 
      arguably the last major European conflict where it was a primary driver. Future conflicts were 
      either internal, such as the Camisards revolt in South-Western France, or relatively minor, like 
      the 1712 Toggenburg War. The war created the outlines of a Europe that persisted until 1815 and 
      beyond, most significantly the nation-state of France, along with the start of a split between 
      Germany and a separate Austro-Hungarian bloc.
